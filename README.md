### Hi there I'm Cedric, better know as Cj ðŸ‘‹

[![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-cj-de-weirt-51928570/)

I work as an IT consultant at Spilberg, a consultancy agency located in Antwerp (BE), Brussels (BE), Amsterdam (NL), and DÃ¼sseldorf (DE).
At this point, I'm providing consultancy work for the Belgian Federal Police as a software analyst and engineer.

My focus lies in developing PHP. Mostly using the Symfony framework.
Besides that my experience includes a couple more frameworks, languages, and CMS.
To give an idea, Bootstrap, Laravel, JavaScript and WordPress are the most frequently used by myself besides PHP and Symfony.

As a developer, you have to constantly develop yourself. Therefore I'm following an extra study in the field of IT at the College of Ghent (HoGent).

Besides working full-time for Spilberg, I have my own side company [CollisionCourse](https://www.collisioncourse.be/). My focus here is mainly on coaching and consulting. Finding the correct solutions for projects and companies. A very small part contains development.

In my remaining (free) time I coach basketball on a pretty high level and love, collecting and building Lego as an Adult Fan of Lego (AFOL).
