### Hi there I'm Cedric, better known as Cj ðŸ‘‹

[![Linkedin](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gVE0j.png) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-cj-de-weirt-51928570/)

I work as an IT consultant at Spilberg, a consultancy agency located in Antwerp (BE), Brussels (BE), Amsterdam (NL), and DÃ¼sseldorf (DE).
Currently, I'm providing consultancy work as a software analyst and engineer.

My focus lies in full-stack development.
Mostly using the Symfony and Laravel framework for the backend. Bootstrap and various style and javascript frameworks for the front end.
Besides that, my experience includes a couple more programming languages and CMS packages. CMS packages going from WordPress (with WooCommerce) to Drupal.
Within the field of CRM, I have a developing experience with Dolibarr.

As a developer, you have to develop yourself constantly. Therefore I'm following an extra study in IT at the College of Ghent (HoGent).

Besides working full-time for Spilberg, I have my own side company [CollisionCourse](https://www.collisioncourse.be/). My focus here is mainly on coaching and consulting. Finding the correct solutions for projects and companies. A very small part contains development.
In my remaining (free) time I coach basketball on a pretty high level and love, collecting and building Lego as an Adult Fan of Lego (AFOL).
