### Hi there I'm Cedric, better known as Cj ðŸ‘‹

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-cj-de-weirt-51928570/)

I work as a consultant at Brightest, a software and consultancy agency located in Kontich (BE), Gent (BE), and Genk (BE).
Currently, I'm providing consultancy work as a software quality engineer for BASF.

My main practice focuses on software testing, mostly automation and performance.
Besides working full-time for Brightest, I have my own side company [CollisionCourse](https://www.collisioncourse.be/).
My focus here is mainly on (sports)coaching and consulting, primarily finding the correct solutions for projects and companies by discovering and collaborating with the right partners.
The other part contains development. Providing companies and people with budget-friendly software solutions. Going from a WordPress CMS to a full web application. 
Using mostly WordPress with WooCommerce, Dolibarr for CRM packages, and Symfony and Laravel frameworks for more complex applications.
Besides that, my experience includes a couple more programming languages and CMS packages.

I'm a very lucky man to have an amazing girlfriend and a curious little cat.
In my remaining (free) time I love basketball, collecting legendary Pokemon cards, and collecting/building Lego as an Adult Fan of Lego (AFOL).
As a person, you have to develop yourself constantly. Therefore I'm following an extra study in IT at the College of Ghent (HoGent).
